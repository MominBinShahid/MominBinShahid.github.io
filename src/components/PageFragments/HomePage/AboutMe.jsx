    <em>My name <strong>is</strong></em> => <span class="devName">Momin Bin Shahid</span>,
    and I am a dedicated <strong>Full-Stack Software Engineer</strong> <emoji>👨‍💻</emoji> with a deep enthusiasm for software engineering and cutting-edge technologies, particularly in the domain of <strong>Web</strong> and <strong>JavaScript</strong> <emoji>🤟</emoji>
    
    <br/>
    <br/>

    With a <strong>Bachelor's Degree</strong> in Computer Science and <strong>over 5 years</strong> of experience in the <strong>software development</strong> <emoji>🛠</emoji> field, complemented by an additional 1+ years in sales and marketing, I possess a profound understanding of the development lifecycle and adhere to industry standards. I thrive on acquiring knowledge about various processes, building innovative solutions, and effectively promoting them to the market.
    
    <br/>
    <br/>

    My expertise lies in creating and maintaining robust solutions utilizing stacks such as <strong>MERN</strong> <emoji>⚛</emoji>, <strong>MEVN</strong>, MEAN, and <strong>JAM</strong>. These ventures span a diverse range of domains, including Internet Privacy and Security, Metadata Platforms, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Human Resource Management Systems (HRMS), EdTech (E-learning platform for educational institutions), and Bioinformatics projects with research institutions, among others.

    <br/>
    <br/>
    
    Throughout my career, I have had the privilege of working with both <strong>service-based</strong> and <strong>product-based</strong> companies, collaborating with clients hailing from the United States, Europe, the Middle East, and other regions across the globe. 

    <br/>
    <br/>
    
    My insatiable curiosity drives me to constantly explore and experiment with emerging technologies and concepts. I am always enthusiastic about developing Web <emoji>🌐</emoji>, Mobile <emoji>📱</emoji>, and Desktop <emoji>💻</emoji> applications using <strong>JavaScript</strong> <emoji>🚀</emoji> and other exciting technologies.
  `,
  paraTwo: `
    In my recent experiences, I have extensively utilized JavaScript-based technologies such as <strong>React.js</strong> <emoji>⚛</emoji>, <strong>Vue.js</strong>, and <strong>Node.js</strong>. Furthermore, I have hands-on experience working with <strong>On-Premise</strong> <emoji>⛰️</emoji> and <strong>Cloud</strong> <emoji>☁️</emoji> infrastructures such as <strong>AWS</strong>, Azure, and <strong>Firebase</strong> (GCP). I have successfully built and maintained monolith, serverless (FaaS), and microservices-based applications, leveraging Docker <emoji>🐳</emoji> and Kubernetes to enhance efficiency, scalability, and portability while ensuring seamless deployment (CI/CD) and management.
    
    <br/>
    <br/>

    My <strong>primary highlight</strong> is that I have a strong passion for solving complex problems and a drive for continuous and quick <emoji>⚡️</emoji> learning, I consistently strive to stay updated with the latest industry trends <emoji>📈</emoji> and technologies. I have a proven track record of successfully delivering high-quality software solutions that meet and exceed client expectations <emoji>👍</emoji>.

    <br/>
    <br/>

    Although my previous experiences have primarily revolved around closed-source <emoji>🔒</emoji> projects, I am increasingly immersing myself in the world of open-source software <emoji>🍀</emoji>
    
    <br/>
    <br/>

    Please feel free to reach out to me for any opportunities or potential collaborations <emoji>🤝</emoji> or just to say hi <emoji>🙋‍♂️</emoji>. I am excited to connect and explore how we can work together. Let's get in touch <emoji>🤙</emoji>
